# Hi everyone

This is my repository I write some thing about my idea in process doing the project.

This project is using technologies such as : ORM sequelize, database mysql, mongodb.

Sometimes I write test code for my function you just run: `npm install` and run `npm test` you can see it.

Besides in Es6-Example directory is the place where the examples I search on internet because of my concern about some
problem help me make clean and beautiful code as syntax, promise, async-await, arrow-function ...

I will be back soon !

*Have a good time: :heart:*
